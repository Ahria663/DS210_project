# Life Expectancy Analysis Project (DS210 Final Project)

#### Name: Baria Mustafa 

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between life expectancy and various socioeconomic factors across different countries. The analysis explores the nuanced differences between developed and developing countries, challenging assumptions about life expectancy determinants.

## Methodology
The analysis was conducted in three main phases:

- Data processing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Graph algorithm implementation for country clustering

## Key Findings
- Strong positive correlation between income levels and education across countries
- Average life expectancy: 79 years in developed countries vs 67 years in developing countries
- Distinct mortality patterns between developing and developed nations
- Different health challenges: developing countries face higher rates of infectious diseases, while developed nations show higher rates of obesity and HIV/AIDS

## Graph Algorithm Results

The clustering analysis based on life expectancy, GDP, and population revealed distinct country groupings:

- Niue (Cluster 1909): Small, isolated countries
- Albania (Cluster 0): Medium development metrics
- Monaco (Cluster 1715): Wealthy, small-population countries

## Dataset
